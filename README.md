# CIG (Custom Item Generator) by UltroGhast
A Python3.8 generator for custom items(+Recipe Generator)
## What is it?
This python script makes easy creating custom items(with nbt), their custom model and their recipe.\
It is suggested to be run inside a datapack and to have a support resource pack(for Custom Model Data).

## How to use
Place it in `.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks/<yourdatapack>`\
The first time you will run it, it will ask you some dates about the datapack.
## Usual Questions
-Why does the generator say "The generator isn't in the right directory!"?\
Simple: there isn't any data folder inside the Datapack folder. Be sure you are using the generator on the right way.
-What is saved_dp_dates.json?
That is the file where the datapack dates you typed the first time you used the generator on that datapack are stored.

Don't copy or distribute(It's illegal, u know?).
